# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Version Control/Cloud saves, Losing Code Sucks

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > make directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A class that piggybacks of a proper class that helps define properties for special states the target class may be in

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > if you have a couple classes like a card, but you want it to have specific properties that override something on the card class, you would use more specific selectors like applying the specific properties with an id instead of a class to be sure they override the card class

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Two attribute definitions that conflict causing weird error behavior

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The selector, shown here as "h1". The property, shown here as "color", and the value, being the rgba value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > A good design makes people believe they are on a website that is legitimate and well thought out website, you can convey what the website is meant for, by adding formal styling you can make a serious business page while you could make a colorful and creative page for something like a gaming site.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Lining out how a website may be formatted so it can be easily converted into code from an outline

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I definitely think that wireframing is a fantastic idea, it will 100% help my coding process in the future

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Flex allows for easier movement/alignment of child divs

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > margin/height/width properties affect the size of element box models
