# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> When a class extends another class and it inherits all of the super's methods

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> The singleton approach ensures that only one instance of the target class exists at one time, exactly how we implement our services within the mvc pattern

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer design pattern uses listeners and state observers to make code reactive and streamlined

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> uses a group of many algorithms in separate classes that can use the same objects to allow many different use cases to be effectively applied at runtime to make sure the program remains flexible

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The factory design pattern defines superclasses in a way that allows subclasses determine more about the functionality of its objects and uses

06. What is test driven development?

> Test driven development is a development approach that defines use cases for a programs expectations before development that constrict the output of the eventually developed product so that the code remains carefully constructed and aligns with needed functionality so that a programmer will not have to change code further down the road. These tests are ran consistently throughout development to ensure that code written adheres to the use cases defined before development

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> Definition of done, sometimes it can be difficult to tell when a codebase is truly "finished" so defining what done means case by case can prevent unfinished code

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> I want to be able to see how many likes a post or comment has up to date without having to reload the page - I should be able to click on a profile picture on any page within a website and have it route me to that users account page

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> Sprint planning is where the scrum master and product owner meet and develop a plan for what tasks should be completed and in what order

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> Tasks are assigned by the development team to the development team, they have to adhere to sprint backlogs but have some freedom within them
